<div class="modal-label mt-5">Timeline</div>
This project was initially handled by 4 people which consists of 2 founders which handles the business side and 2
developers. We manage to create the main features of 6 applications (mobile app and website) just within 6 months of
development. The main framework that we used for the web application are Codeigniter as a PHP framework and Bootstrap for the UI. While the mobile version we used the Ionic Framework. After the base
is finished, we focused on improving the applications and bug fixing.

<div class="modal-label mt-4">My Contributions</div>
Since I'm a part of the foundation of these applications, I get to give my ideas and decide many things. The following
are my contributions for this project:
<ul class="mt-3">
  <li>Create a web application from scratch using a number of frameworks such as Bootstrap & Codeigniter</li>
  <li>Decide the UI/UX and the backend structure of the web application and mobile apps</li>
  <li>Involve in development of hybrid mobile apps</li>
  <li>Suggest and implement improvements of the created applications</li>
</ul>
