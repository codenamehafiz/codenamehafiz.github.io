<div class="modal-label">About:</div>
SHTJ is a web application that has 24 modules which have interelation with each other. This project is done by following
the agile development method and was planned to go live in 10 months after development. The web application is developed
by using the CodeIgniter framework. <br><br>Since this is a government project, I can't disclose too much information in
here but to make people understand better, I created a diagram which shows one of the application's flow:

  </a>
</div>

<div class="modal-label mt-4">My Contributions:</div>
Initially, I was tasked to design all the UI of the application. This include the receipt and slip of different
transactions done by the application. Once the UI is completed, I joined in the backend/server-side development.

<div class="modal-label mt-4">Links</div>
The following are the grayscale image links for some of the UI that I have created:
<ul class="mt-3">
  <li><a href="img/screen/shtj-screen-1.png" target="_blank">Menu</a></li>
  <li><a href="img/screen/shtj-screen-2.png" target="_blank">Search</a></li>
  <li><a href="img/screen/shtj-screen-3.png" target="_blank">Payment</a></li>
</ul>
