<div class="modal-label">About:</div>
Kiasu Perks as a whole consists of four parts which is the mobile app, the admin management page, the merchant page and
the landing page. The mobile app is for any user to use while the admin portal is for the admin and merchants which allow 
them to post and manage the discount coupons into the mobile app.

<div class="modal-label mt-4">Mobile App:</div>
The mobile app is where the users can enjoy various discounts by claiming the promotional codes that are
available inside of the app.

On the first version of the app, the team and I developed the app in Unity but was eventually scrapped as the app was
too laggy and suffers several performance issues. To solve this problem, the chief suggested for us to recreate the app
using Ionic Framework which have been maintained until the official release of the app.

<div class="modal-label mt-5">Admin Management Page:</div>
The admin management page will allow the admin to add and manage the merchants. Moreover, admin can also control which
discount counpons be shown in the mobile app.

<div class="modal-label mt-5">Merchant Management Page:</div>
The merchant management website will give access to merchants for them to create and manage their own promotions that
will appear on the mobile app.

The websites are developed using Bootstrap as the UI and basic PHP without any library. Moreover, AJAX is used in
calling the API to show and manipulate the data on the webpage.

<div class="modal-label mt-5">Landing Page:</div>
This is the promotional website for users to know more information about the mobile app.
